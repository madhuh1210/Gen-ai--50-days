50 DAYS OF LEARNING GEN AI

1987- frank rosen blad created the first compter -> perceptron
its a smart computer 
u can ask only yes or no questions , it draws a staright line to make it decision 
later 1980s they thought that one brain cells weren't enough so they developed different neurons together this develope neural networks
its like having a grp convo instead of talking to one person
when network made mistakes all the neurons would learn from it .. this process is called back probagation.
now they could tell hand writing diff n diff faces
neural networks on top of each other -> deeplearning : each layer learns smtg more complex than the one before it
later came the paper called attention is all u need which was about tranformers,it focused on smtg attention -> language context 
gen ai dont do stuff they create new things -> we have got llms like gpt 
we have diffusion models that make art 
multi model ai- text images videos etc etc
nobody taught it creativity they figured it out on their own
